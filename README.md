# RiemannPy

A small Python program that visually approximates the area of a function over a given interval using a (Riemann sum)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum]. It can take left and right sums, and knows the Midpoint and Trapezoid Rules.

It's really slow because it uses the Turtle library. But speed wasn't a priority since this is for an APCSP Performance Task.

There is no config file or user input in the program at the moment, so you'll have to mess around with the code to change the approximation method, function, number of subintervals, and domain. I've left plenty of comments so hopefully it should be easy enough.
